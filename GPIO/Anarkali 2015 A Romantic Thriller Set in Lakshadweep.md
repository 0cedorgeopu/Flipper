He has also written some witty dialogues for the characters, especially for Biju Menon who plays Zachariah.
 
Prithviraj Sukumaran delivers a convincing performance as Shanthanu, the navy officer who is torn between his duty and love. He portrays the emotions of his character with subtlety and grace. He also looks dashing in his navy uniform and diving suit. Priyal Gor, who is a Hindi television actress, makes her Malayalam debut as Nadira Imam. She has a charming screen presence and shares a good chemistry with Prithviraj. Biju Menon steals the show with his comic timing and hilarious expressions. He provides the comic relief in the film and also supports Prithviraj's character as his loyal friend.
 
The supporting cast of the film includes Miya George as Sherin, Shanthanu's colleague and friend; Suresh Krishna as Jaffer Imam, Nadira's father and a strict navy officer; Arun as Naseeb Imam, Nadira's brother and Shanthanu's rival; Sudev Nair as Dheeraj Iyengar, Shanthanu's friend and colleague; Kabir Bedi as Koya Moideen, a wealthy businessman and Nadira's fiance; and Samskruthy Shenoy as Parvathy, Zachariah's wife. They all do justice to their roles and add value to the film.
